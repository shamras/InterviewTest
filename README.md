# InterviewTest

1. This Framework was created with MAVEN and Selenium I used dependencies such Testng, and maven surefire plug in for report Generating. I also used Log4j for a another HTML reporting but I have not added log listerners to the entire code base.
2. In Order to run these tests ensure you have a selenium webdriver for google or it can be added via the dependency in my case I had one on my local, once you have this you can change set system properties.
3. I also used Jenkings to Run the tests, I did not include the Jenkin.war as it is something I have on my local. Once I use Jenkins I would add my pom.xml File to the MVN test run link and run these tests.


4. The postman collection I was able to create a new user, and bring up one user. I could not bring up 10 users because the api did not have much to go on for searching or filtering infact never had these in the documenation.
